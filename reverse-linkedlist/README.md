# Reverse Linkedlist

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, 
reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

## Intuition

- Linear iteration and one-index counting 
- reversing can be achieved by stack or by using three pointers and changing next pointers to previous

## Problem 3

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.
