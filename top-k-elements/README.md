## Problem 2

Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Implement KthLargest class:

    KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
    int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

## Problem 3

Given an array of points where points\[i\] = \[xi, yi\] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

## Problem 4

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?
