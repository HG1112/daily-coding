# Sub tree

## Problem 1

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

## Problem 2

Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

## Problem 3

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Problem 4

Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.
