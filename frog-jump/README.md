# Jump 

## Problem 1

A frog is crossing a river. 

The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone.

The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone.

Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units.

The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

## Problem 3

You are given an integer array cost where cost\[i\] is the cost of ith step on a staircase.

Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
