# Binary Search

## Problem 1

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target,

write a function to search target in nums.

If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Problem 2

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
