# Grid

## Problem 1

Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

## Problem 2

given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. return the answer in any order.

a mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. note that 1 does not map to any letters.

## Problem 3

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

## Problem 4

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. 

You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Problem 5

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. 

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

## Problem 6

There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights\[r\]\[c\] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height.

Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result\[i\] = \[ri, ci\] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
